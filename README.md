# Brain Tumor Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

The aim of this project was to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of categorizing brain tumors based on MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images. The model was trained to differentiate between different types of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary adenoma.

Additionally, the project includes a web application created using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface to interact with the trained model.

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of MRI images of patients with various types of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The dataset is sourced from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset).
